# Goal

Make a model that when fed an image can find a face and estimate as to what emotion the individual is experiencing.


# Needed to Run

* Pandas
* Numpy
* OpenCV - cv2
* Tensorflow
* tqdm

# Data 
[Emotic Dataset](http://sunai.uoc.edu/emotic/)

*R. Kosti, J.M. √Ålvarez, A. Recasens and A. Lapedriza, "Context based emotion recognition using emotic dataset", IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence (PAMI), 2019.*

This dataset is broken up into two different kind of measurments: categorical and continuous. For our purposes at this moment, we will just need a subset of the categorical emotions.
