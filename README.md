# Goal

Make a model that when fed an image can find a face and estimate as to what emotion the individual is experiencing.


# Needed to Run

* Pandas
* Numpy
* OpenCV - cv2
* Tensorflow
* tqdm

# Data 
[Emotic Dataset](http://sunai.uoc.edu/emotic/)

*R. Kosti, J.M. √Ålvarez, A. Recasens and A. Lapedriza, "Context based emotion recognition using emotic dataset", IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence (PAMI), 2019.*

This dataset is broken up into two different kind of measurments: categorical and continuous. For our purposes at this moment, we will just need a subset of the categorical emotions.



# Classifiers
## Haar-Cascade
I chose to use the Haar-Cascade Classifiers found in OpenCV to be able to reliably pull faces out of different images. The current focus of the model was just to detect the emotion of the faces given, however, further down the road I would like to revisit this to replace it with 

# CNN

The example above is purely for explanation purposes of how the model works and not representative of the exact numbers or layers.
